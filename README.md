# Investigating Trends of Absences in Toronto City Council Attendance between 2022 to 2026

## Overview

This paper examines trends in meeting absences for the Toronto City Council from 2022 to 2026 using data from Open Data Toronto. The study analyzes the absences of council members and patterns across meeting types and times. Individual council members' absence records are compared, with members like Michael Thompson and Jaye Robinson showing higher rates. Results show that afternoon sessions have the highest absence rates and found an increase in absences since 2022. By understanding these trends, future meetings can be scheduled more strategically to improve attendance and ensure effective representation.
